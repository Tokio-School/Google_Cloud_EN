# **Cost planning**

Unit M2U1 - Exercise 7

**What are we going to do?**

1. Plan Google Cloud costs and make sample budgets.

**Before getting started**

1. Access the web console: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Log in with your user account if necessary.
3. Once inside the console, check that you are working on your project. You can check this in the project information card in the control panel on the home page or in the project selection drop-down menu to the left of the blue top bar (next to the 3 blank hexagons).
4. You can divide your desktop into 2 horizontal windows, one with the console and one with the instructions.
5. If during the exercise you need to access Cloud Shell, you can activate it in the ">_" icon on the right in the blue top bar. You can use the terminal in the same window of the console or maximise it and open it in a new window. You can also access the terminal directly at [shell.cloud.google.com](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) and the IDE at [ide.cloud.google.com](https://ide.cloud.google.com/).

_Note: There are no questions for this exercise._

**Task 1: Cost Calculator and Price List**

For the first task, let's explore some price lists for Google Cloud services and the cost calculator.

**Price list**

In the documentation of each service we can find the information on the costs of the same, along with all the necessary details and several examples of use cases with the detail and total of the associated costs.

You can find the costs at the end of the documentation page for each service (you can search for it in a web search engine) or in the general [price list](https://cloud.google.com/pricing/list).

Search and analyse the detailed costs and examples for the following services:

- Compute Engine - VM Instances
- Cloud storage
- Cloud Run
- Cloud Firestore

**Google Cloud Cost Calculator**

The Google Cloud Cost Calculator is the ideal tool to generally explore the costs of a solution or to make detailed budgets for a proposal.

Access it: [Cost Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator).

1. Analyse the cost calculator, and familiarise yourself with the different sections.
2. Explore the different services, and try adding some VM instances (and disks) e.g.
3. Change the results to show prices in â‚¬.
4. Modify and delete resources to see how to modify a budget.
5. At the end, save the budget and/or send it by email. When the budget is created, it generates a URL with a unique budget ID.

**Task 2: Sample budgets**

In this task you will create 3 sample budgets using the cost calculator. Remember to create a different quote for each of them (removing the budget ID from the URL to create a new one if necessary).

**Budget 1 - simple environment**

Create the following budget and save your URL:

1. Region: europe-west1.
2. 3 instances of e2-standard-8 Ubuntu VM.
  1. No external IPs.
  2. Running 24/7.
  3. 200 GB zonal balanced disk per instance.
  4. 200 GB multiregional snapshot per instance.
3. 1 TB of internet download/egress traffic to Europe monthly.

# **Exercise Submission Instructions**

To submit an assignment, follow these steps:

1. Create an exercise delivery folder for all practice exercises
2. For the delivery folder, follow the following nomenclature: &quot;M2U[unit number]-[student name]&quot;
  - E.g. &quot;M2U2-Marcos Manuel Ortega&quot;
3. Within each delivery folder, create one subfolder per exercise
4. For the exercise subfolder, follow the nomenclature: &quot;M2U[unit number]-[exercise number]-[exercise name]
  - E.g. &quot;M2U2-1-Cloud\_console&quot;
  - E.g. &quot;M2U2-2-Cloud\_SDK&quot;
5. For each exercise, follow the steps below:

  1. Carefully follow the exercise instructions in your markdown file to complete it
  2. Include in the folder any text file, screenshot, code file, exported file, etc. indicated in the instructions
  3. For these files, follow the name or nomenclature indicated in the instructions or, by default, the following nomenclature: &quot;M2U[unit number]-[exercise number] -task\_[task number] -file\_[file number in the task]-[file type: screenshot, exported, script]\_[file number if there are more than 1 of the same type]&quot;
    - For example, &quot;M2U2-1-task\_1-file\_1-screenshot.png&quot;
    - For example, &quot;M2U2-1-task\_2-file\_1-screenshot\_1.jpg&quot;
    - For example, &quot;M2U2-1-task\_2-file\_2-script.py&quot;
    - For example, &quot;M2U2-1-task\_2-file\_3-screenshot\_2.jpg&quot;
    - For example, &quot;M2U2-1-task\_3-file\_1-exported\_1.csv&quot;
    - For example, &quot;M2U2-1-task\_4-file\_1-exported\_1.csv&quot;
    - For example, &quot;M2U2-1-task\_4-file\_2-exported\_2.csv&quot;
  4. For all the questions in an exercise, you can create a single file with this nomenclature: &quot;M2U[unit number]-[exercise number]-questions.txt.&quot;
    - E.g. &quot;M2U2-1-questions.txt&quot;
  5. Within the question file, identify and sort each question by copying the question text and then including the answer text.
    - Below in this document you will find a sample question and answer structure.
1. Once you have completed all the assignments for a submission, compress the submission folder into a single file (in any format, preferably ZIP), make sure that the compressed file follows the same nomenclature and submit it through the platform.
2. If you are having trouble progressing and want the teacher to help you, you can compress the sub-folder of an exercise and send it by message on the platform. If there are several exercises, you can follow the same instructions as for handing in a practical exercise.

Example of the structure of the answers to the questions file:

M2U1-1-questions.txt
